* Teacher's pet is **an application for NUS teaching students to handle their students information**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * As a tutor I can use this application to efficiently handle the information of my students. 
  * When a tutor arrives to class, they can start this application to view all their students' information. 
  * Tutors can add, delete, list, filter and edit their students information to effectively handle their students admin details. 
* The project builds on an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC).
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Teacher's pet` (`TP` for short) because it will aid teachers as one would expect from a "teacher's pet".
* It was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Teacher's pet Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w10-1.github.io/tp/)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
